# Ride Sharing Landing Page

This is a fully responsive landing page for a ride sharing app. I built it with HTML, JS, and used SASS as a CSS preprocessor.

**This is not my design. I took [this design template](https://www.uxcrush.com/ride-sharing-figma-website-template/) and turned it into a functional webpage for the practice.**
